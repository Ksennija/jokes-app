This is the second Mini-app in ReDI School. It displays 4 random jokes, and when user clicks Show, shoes joke's solution. User can save the jokes to the Library. By the Refresh button Api fetches with new jokes.

With this Mini-app I learned to use Api to get data, Module CSS and some other useful things.
